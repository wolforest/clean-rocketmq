# Learning and Neurons
Learning is a process of forming and strengthening connections between neurons.

## Steps of  learning
1. Observation
2. Imitation
3. Review
4. Recreation
5. new learning loop

## Observation
Build connections between the knowledge already in your mind and new incoming information.

## Imitation
Discover new information through imitation, and use it to build additional neural connections.

## Review
Find more data and build more connections.
Revisit what you've learned to reinforce existing connections and uncover new ones.

## Recreation
Combine old knowledge and new information to form deeper and more integrated neural connections.
