# Decisions in Software
Making decisions is the hardest part of software development.

## From business to software decisions
Software is part of the business. <br />
There is another part of the business that is not software.

### What is the business with software?
What is business? <br />
Business is the process of making money. <br />
Business creates value, then transfer value to money. <br />
Same answer for the business with software.

### How does business create value?
Business creates what people need. <br />
But people don't know what they need. <br />
So Business starts with a guess.

A guess of who needs help. <br />
A guess of what kind of help they need. <br />
A guess of what to do to meet their needs. 

The guess is the business decision. <br />
The decision will create value, if it is right.
