# Software And AI
AI is so powerful that it can do things that we can't even imagine. <br />
AI is so powerful that it can build software with a simple idea. <br />
AI is so powerful that We are afraid to be replaced by it.

As a software engineer, <br />
We need to understand the future of AI; <br />
We need to understand the future of software; <br />
We need to understand the future of ourselves;

To understand the future of Software, We need to understand the first principle of Software; <br />
I mean the hardest part of software -- If AI can handle the hardest part then we are done, totally done.

## The hardest part of software
Coding is not hard, not hard at all. <br />
People who knows english, can do it with some practice. <br />
AI can do it, but that's not a big deal, cause coding is not a big deal.

Writing good code is hard, too hard that no one can tell the secret of it. <br />
AI know the secret, but we all know that is not true.

I've been coding for more than 16 years, but I've never thought about the hardest part of software. <br />
It's time to think about it, right now, at this moment. We have no time to waste.

### Some options
* uncertainty makes software hard
* high performance makes software hard
* communication makes software hard
* security makes software hard
* scalability makes software hard
* maintainability makes software hard
* testability makes software hard
* ... ...

too many options, we need to find a way to reduce them. <br />
maybe we can find out why we build software, this question may help us.

### Why we build software?
We build software to solve problems. <br />
What kind of problems? 
* Problems that have never been solved before. 
* Problems that we are not sure is it really a problem.
* Problems that we are not sure how to solve.
* ... ...
We can't think too much, we need to solve the problem, with or without solution.

### Solution base on guess
We don't know if the solution works, but we need to start. <br />
So we start, then fail, then do some adjustments, then try again, then loop the process. <br />
Yes, this is how we build software.

### Back to the hardest part
The hardest part of software is uncertainty. <br />
We do everything with the uncertainty, and what we do bring more uncertainty. <br />
At most time, we don't know what we are building, which problem we are solving. <br />
But we have not choice, we can't stop, we need make another decision. 

Bingo, Making decisions is the hardest part.
* Choose a name is a decision.
* Choose a language is a decision.
* Choose a framework is a decision.
* ... ...
A lot of decisions, make the software.

## Can AI make decisions?
Yes and No. 
Yes if AI was trust by people.
Yes if approved by people.

## Principles of software with AI
* People are responsible for the output of AI.
* People make decisions.
* AI helps people.



## Some misunderstandings of software
* Software with more code is more powerful.
* Software needs adding more code.
* Every line of code is useful.
